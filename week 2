    <p2 align="center"><span class="mypara">A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and
        consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life.
        The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to
        the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the
        world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where
        little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts
        or "cold deserts". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation
        that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification
        or by their geographical location.</span></p2><br>
